Computer networks have a significant impact on the working of an organization. Universities depend on the proper functioning and analysis of their networks for education, administration, communication, e-library, automation, etc. An efficient network is essential to facilitate the systematic and cost-efficient transfer of information in an organization in the form of messages, files, and resources.  The project provides insights into various concepts such as topology design, IP  address configuration, and how to send information in the form of packets to the wireless networks of different areas of a University.

The aim of this project is to design the topology of the university network using the software Cisco Packet Tracer with the implementation of wireless networking systems. This university network consists of the following devices:

1) Router (1941)
2) Switches (2960-24TT)
3) Email server 
4) DNS server
5) WEB server (HTTP)
6) Wireless Device (Access Point)
7) PCs
8) Laptops 
9) Smartphones

The design includes the following parts of the University:
Hostel Blocks: Girls Block and Boys Block
Academic Blocks: AB1 and AB2
Dome Building and Library
IT Consulting
